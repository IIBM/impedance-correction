# impedance-correction

This project involves the design, development and prototyping of an automated
**electrode impedance meter and corrector** for biological applications.

This will be achieved in the context of a basic embedded systems subject of the
Electronic Engineering career at the University of Buenos Aires:
[Laboratorio de Microcomputadoras](http://materias.fi.uba.ar/6609/).
